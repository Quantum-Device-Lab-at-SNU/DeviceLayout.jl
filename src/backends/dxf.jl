module DXF
# Experimental dxf export
# Presently commented out for a branch with no PyCall dependency
# To be rebuilt without PyCall

# Requires ezdxf in the Python environment PyCall uses
# You can install it in Julia's internal conda (at least on Windows) with:
#   ```
#   julia> using PyCall
#   julia> pyimport_conda("ezdxf", "ezdxf", "conda-forge")
#   ```

# Version 0: Get polygons in right format then just call out to ezdxf
# Two possible directions: use more of ezdxf, or just
# start implementing the important subset to remove dependency

####### Example from ezdxf README
####### Only changes: Rewrite Python dictionaries in Julia syntax
####### Single quotes were also replaced with double quotes
####### That is, `{'color':2}` became `Dict("color" => 2)`, etc

# # (Really, cell references should become block references,
# # there might be more DXF attributes in the metadata...)

    save(file::File{format"DXF"}, c::Cell, python::String)

Export a `Cell` to a DXF file. Uses the `ezdxf` program in Python, and requires
the python executable path that has that package installed
(could simply be `python`, or `/Users/user/.julia/conda/3/bin/python`).
Generates a Python script and runs it, to avoid PyCall dependency.
